# README File of day 2 :
## What's in there ? 
- One ``` practice.html``` File, in which I practiced without any help what I learned about html's forms.
- One ``` index.html``` File, in which I changed the About Me page of day 1.
- 2 Photos, icons i tried to put so the page can be at least a little visual.

## Difficulties
I had some difficulties on git commands
- During commitment i did not commit in the good place at first
- I had to change branch ( was master now main ) -> i didn't know how to do that
  - used github's doc.

### Thanks for reading this !
