# README File of day 2 :
## What's in there ? 
- One ``` practice.html``` File, in which I practiced without any help what I learned about html's forms.
- One ``` index.html``` File, in which I changed the About Me page of day 1.
- 2 Photos, icons i tried to put so the page can be at least a little visual.

## Difficulties
I had some difficulties on git commands
- During commitment i did not commit in the good place at first
- I had to change branch ( was master now main ) -> i didn't know how to do that
  - used github's doc.

### Thanks for reading this ! 

# Day 6 Notes - Responsive Design

## Media Queries Syntax

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    /*Styles for screens 768px or smaller*/
}

## Common Breakpoints

- Mobile: max-width: 480px
- Tablet: max-width: 768px
- Desktop: max-width: 1024px
- Large screens: min-width: 1200px

## Mobile-First Approach

1. Design for mobile first (smallest screen)
2. Add media queries for larger screens
3. Use min-width instead of max-width

## Responsive Units

- % → Percentage of parent
- vw, vh → Viewport width/height
- rem → Relative to root font size
- em → Relative to parent font size

## Chrome DevTools

F12 → Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)
Test different screen sizes
